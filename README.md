# jacobianPlotter
Basic plotter to generate plots of jacobians from ascii files spit out of the GSI. both the jacobians straight out of the CRTM, and ones modified by the GSI to put in terms of control variables, along with some kind of inflation/deflation (especially water vapor above the tropopause).
